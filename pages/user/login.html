        <h1>Dummy Login Page</h1>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You have to replace the code in login.html with your project's login page.</li>
            <li>Read the code in login.js page. </li>
            <li><strong>For every feature that requires database access, you have to replace
                    localStorage getItem/setItem with Fetch API.</strong></li>
            <li>The data will be sent to database through backend using Fetch API.</li>


            <h3>If you wish to try the login feature, complete these steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Rename database name to <code>store</code> in the <code>api/utils/database.js</code> file</li>
                <li>Open MySQL Workbench and make changes mentioned in the <code>changes_to_store.md</code> file to the
                    store database.</li>
                <li>Open Developer Tools and open the 'Network' tab to see the details of the API that will be sent.
                </li>
                <li>Enter phone number <em>404-246-3370</em> and password <em>Abcdefgh@123</em> for successful
                    login.</li>
                <li>Once submitted, you should be able to see 'login' with status '200' in the Netwroks tab. You may
                    open it to see the details. ;)</li>
                <li>Check localStorage. You should be able to see the userId: 10 data in it. Open MySQL Workbench and
                    run <code>SELECT customer_id FROM store.customers WHERE phone="404-246-3370";</code>. The data was
                    sent to database through backend and the customer_id was retrieved and then stored to localStorage.
                    Interesting? :D</li>
                <li>You should perform the above steps in the store-full-stack repo (after cloning it). There you would
                    be able to appreciate the completeness of a full-stack application!</li>
                <li>Hope these steps kindled interest in you to complete your project into a full-stack application.
                    <em>For
                        every module in your project, you can add a controller, a model and a router. In the frontend,
                        you have to
                        replace
                        code that stores module data to localStorage with fetch APIs.<br>
